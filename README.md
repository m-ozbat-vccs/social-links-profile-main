## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom variables
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Leveraging margin:auto; and padding can be just as effective as using positioning, flexbox, or grid. I was so focused on mastering flexbox, it was nice to use simple properties to achieve a desired result. 

### Continued development

I ran into issues using text-align on an inline image to center it. I had to use margin:auto after turning the image into a block-level element. I will need to look into the best layout solutions among flexbox, grid, positioning, and margin/padding. This was a nice break from trying to fit everything into a flexbox. 


### Useful resources
W3 schools variables, and a mob coding class session with Professor Kenyada McLeod at Brightpoint Community College in Virginia.
